 🔑 **Key Features:**

1. **Wi-Fi Scanning and Enumeration:**  
   Detect nearby wireless networks and capture handshakes for further analysis.

2. **Wi-Fi Deauthentication (DDoS) Attacks:**  
   Launch deauthentication attacks on targeted BSSIDs to disconnect clients and force handshake captures.

3. **Decrypt CAP Files:**  
   Use brute-force attacks with a password dictionary to crack captured handshakes using `aircrack-ng`.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:**  
   Enjoy colorful ASCII art and enhanced user prompts, powered by `toilet`, `lolcat`, and `cowsay`.
